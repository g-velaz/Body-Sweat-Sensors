# Body Sweat Sensor Prototype
This is intelligence part of the virtual reality headset sweat protector, which is built for NASA's virtual reality headsets with the help of San Jacinto Community College's research team for summer 2019. 

This project currently alerts the user if said user is sweating a certain level that would ruin the virtual reality headset the user is wearing. Since this project is a prototype at its current stage, other sensors can be implemented in the future (heartbeat, oxygen level, glucose level, etc.) in order to monitor the user's stress and strain on the body while performing tasks in the headset. 

> For more information pertaining to the project, please look at the [documentation](https://github.com/g-velaz/Body-Stress-Sensors/blob/master/VR%20Headset%20Documentation%20PDF.pdf) or [presentation](https://github.com/g-velaz/Body-Stress-Sensors/blob/master/VR%20Headset%20Presentation%20PDF.pdf) found in the repo.

> All materials are listed inside in both the presentation and code. The digital humidity-temperature library (included inside repo) source found [here](http://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-the-dht11-humidity-sensor-on-an-arduino/).
